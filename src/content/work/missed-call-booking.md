An agency serving local service businesses needed a way to stop losing leads when the phone went unanswered. I built an n8n system that detects the missed call, sends the caller a WhatsApp message, and offers a booking link so the lead can book without waiting for a callback.

## What the system does

- Detects missed calls and triggers a follow-up right away
- Sends a WhatsApp message with a booking link
- Logs every lead and outcome so the agency can report to its clients
- Alerts the team when a step fails

Delivered in milestones so the agency could test each part before moving on.
