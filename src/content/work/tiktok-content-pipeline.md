A creator wanted to turn long videos into short clips and post them across platforms without doing it by hand. I built an n8n pipeline that sends videos to Vizard for clipping, tracks each clip in Airtable, and publishes on a schedule.

## What the system does

- Sends new videos for clipping automatically
- Tracks clip status and approvals in Airtable
- Publishes approved clips to multiple platforms on a schedule
